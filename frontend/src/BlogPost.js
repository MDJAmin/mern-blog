            Beats Studio Pro are getting one of AirPodsâ€™ best features. A
            firmware update, noted by 9to5Mac, is delivering multi-user audio
            sharing, allowing music to be streamed to multiple headphones at
            once. Apple regularly releases features to its AirPods line before
            they make their way to the Beats brand.
